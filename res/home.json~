These projects are research-focused, and contribute to the efforts of researchers from many disciplines at the University. In this way, we are fostering an unprecedented level of engagement both between disciplines, and between undergraduates and researchers. This program is supported by enrollment in a 1.5 credit class at Penn State (CMPSC 397A and 497C).</p></br><h5 class='subheading'>Our Vision</h5><p class='text'>Ultimately, our goal is to mold Penn State's exceptional CSE students into successful and professional software engineers. Combined with our unique relationship with Penn State's researchers, we can also bring computing power into their hands, and further Penn State's position as one of the world leaders in research."
